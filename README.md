# module4-challenge
I am creating a coding quiz using html, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The quiz will have multiple choice questions, and you have a set amount of time to complete it.
In the top left corner of the page, you can click on the "View high scores" button and it will take you to the page to view high scores.
